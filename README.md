This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# First Test Assignment

# Test Assignment

## Task

The goal of this assignment is to replicate a specified component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (if necessary). Your task involves accurately recreating a component based on the provided design from Figma, ensuring it mirrors the original design's aesthetics and functionality as closely as possible. It is crucial that the result is as pixel-perfect as possible. Additionally, make sure to launch the prototype in Figma to see all the component details.

## Requirements

1. Access to the Design: [[Link to the Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/dwBFtlKY933OJWWSrGPs5q/Frontend?node-id=0-1)].
2. Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if needed). The use of frameworks
   such as React, Vue, Angular is allowed, depending on the candidate's preferences.
3. Interactivity: If there are interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links, input forms) within the component, they should be functional.
4. Code: The code should be clean, well-organized, and easy to read.

## Submission

Provide a link to a live version of your project using GitHub Pages, CodePen, Vercel, Netify or similar services.

PS: The code should be hosted on GitHub in a public repository. Please note that I may request access to this repository if further review is needed.

## Deadline

The assignment should be completed and submitted for review within 48h.

## Conclusion

To ensure you have read and understood the requirements and agree to the deadline, please send a confirmation message stating that you have started working on the test assignment. From the moment we receive your confirmation, the 48-hour period will begin.

Wishing you the best of luck!
